Machine Problem: Simple Library Management System (Web-based) 

Objectives :

1. Apply fundamental concepts of web development (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP). 
2. Practice CRUD operations with a simple database using MySQL. 
3. Collaborate effectively using Git and GitHub. 
4. Demonstrate version control practices: branching, merging, pull requests, and resolving conflicts. 

Problem Description 
Create a lightweight web application that allows librarians and users to manage a catalog of books. The 
core functionality must include: 
• Book Management: Librarians should be able to add new books, edit book details, and remove 
books from the catalog. 
• Catalog Interaction: Users and librarians must be able to browse and view the entire catalog, as 
well as search for specific books. 
• Borrowing & Returns: The system must also include functionality for users to borrow books and 
for librarians to manage the return process. 
This project is a group laboratory exam, and all team members are required to use Git for code 
collaboration and version control throughout the development process.
